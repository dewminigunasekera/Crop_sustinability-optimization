# 🌾 CropYield-Sustainability: Agricultural & Environmental Optimization via ML

This project explores **agricultural optimization and sustainability** using machine learning predictions on crop yield data.  
It focuses on minimizing input usage (fertilizer and pesticide) while maintaining or improving yields — directly contributing to both **agricultural sustainability** and **environmental sustainability**.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To leverage ML models and domain knowledge to:
- Recommend **optimal fertilizer usage** per crop
- Identify **efficient states** with sustainable practices
- Support data-driven decision-making for farmers, investors, and policymakers

---

## 🧪 Methods Applied

- **Random Forest Regression** for predicting yield and finding fertilizer plateaus
- **Custom efficiency metric**:  
  \[
  \text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Yield}}{\text{Fertilizer} \times \text{Pesticide}}
  \]
- **State-wise ranking** to find best and worst performing regions per crop
- **Time-series yield trend analysis** to observe improvements in farming practices

---

## 🌿 Key Insights

- **Puducherry** emerged as the most sustainable region across multiple crops  
- **Optimal fertilizer levels** were identified for major grains and pulses  
- **Yield trends over time** showed increased farmer awareness and adoption of biotechnology  
- Modeling scope was ethically limited to sustainability-aligned outcomes (no over-prediction misuse)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook directly in **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and plots
3. Modify or extend with other sustainability metrics as needed



## 🧠 Credits

Developed with scientific focus and data ethics in mind.  
Execution supported via AI tooling (ChatGPT), but **strategy, insights, and modeling decisions are author-driven**.
